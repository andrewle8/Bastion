Bastion aims to provide helper utility modules for end-game content where rotations may need to have a greater understanding of different mechanics, such as boss ability timers, critical debuffs to dispel, and awareness of where the player is within the given contents map (Such as having an understanding that we may be close to a difficult boss, so we should aim to save our cooldowns)

While these are all great things in theory, the module is still in early development and may take some time to include these features, and more.

The current end-game modules available are listed below
