Welcome to the Bastion repository. 

While Bastion is still quite basic in implementation, I believe that it is highly expandable and if the practices which are currently in place remain followed, it will grow into a very performant and notable project. 

The documentation will come soon enough. 

Developers can reference my [Restoration Druid](https://git.tinkr.site/4n0n/bastion/src/branch/main/scripts/restodruid.lua) script if they wish, or reference the provided documentation if they need. 

Once downloaded and in-game to activate Bastion type `/bastion toggle` and to toggle a Bastion Module type `/bastion module <module_name>`
